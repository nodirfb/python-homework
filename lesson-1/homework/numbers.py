# Homework:
# 1. Given a side of square. Find its perimeter and area.

side = 12
perimeter = side * 4
area = side * side

print(perimeter,area)

# 2. Given diameter of circle. Find its length.
import math
diameter = 15
length = diameter * math.pi
print(length)


# 3. Given two numbers a and b. Find their mean.

a = 10
b = 15

mean = (a + b) /2
print(mean)


# 4. Given two numbers a and b. Find their sum, product and square of each number.

a = 10
b = 15

sum = a+b
product = a*b
squarea = a**2
squareb = b**2
print(sum,product,squarea,squareb)
